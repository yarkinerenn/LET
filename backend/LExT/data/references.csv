Are patients with Werlhof's disease at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery?,Patients with WD may possibly undergo cardiac surgery without a markedly enhanced risk for bleeding complications despite a more than usual transfusion requirement and significantly lower platelet counts perioperatively.,no,"Based on the given context and the study's findings, here's a simple explanation in plain terms:

### Why the Answer is ""Yes"":

We're evaluating whether patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are at a higher risk for bleeding problems during heart surgery using a machine called extracorporeal circulation (which helps the heart and lungs while surgery is done).

Looking at the numbers:

- **WD Patients**: Their platelet counts (important for blood clotting) were much lower than those without WD, even after getting treatment with immunoglobulins (a type of medicine). This means their blood wasn't clotting as well.
- **On the day before, during, and after surgery**: Their platelet counts were still significantly lower than people without WD, making them more prone to bleeding.
- **More Bleeding Needed**: These WD patients required more blood product transfusions (specifically, platelets) after surgery, which indicates more bleeding occurred or was anticipated.
- **Bleeding Complications**: Even though the total blood lost was similar between the groups, a higher number of WD patients (10%) had to go back into surgery for bleeding issues compared to those without WD (6%). This shows WD patients were actually at a higher risk for serious bleeding problems requiring intervention.

In short, the study shows that WD patients face a **real risk** for bleeding complications during and after this surgery. The lower platelet counts and higher need for treatment directly link WD with increased bleeding risks, which supports the ""yes"" answer.",yes,"It is generally assumed, that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Therefore we performed this case control study to estimate the real risk for bleeding complications of these patients.
Between 05/95 and 07/98, ten patients with WD (eight males, two females) underwent cardiac surgery employing extracorporeal circulation (WD-group). Five of these patients with platelet counts below 80/nl were treated by immunoglobulins preoperatively. Each patient with WD was matched to five patients without WD (no-WD-group) using diagnosis, age, gender, ejection fraction, number of distal anastomosis and body-mass-index as matching criteria.
Mean number of platelet counts were significant lower in the WD-group than in the no-WD-group despite a significant increase of platelet counts after immunoglobulin treatment (54/nl-->112/nl, P=0.018).

- **On the day before, during, and after surgery**: While their platelet counts were slightly lower, they didn't significantly impact the surgery or the need for blood transfusions.
- **Similar Bleeding Rates**: The total blood lost during surgery was similar between WD patients and those without WD, indicating that bleeding rates were not drastically different.
- **No Significant Interventions**: Only a few WD patients (6%) required additional surgery due to bleeding issues, which is comparable to the rate for patients without WD (5%). This shows that WD patients were not significantly more prone to serious bleeding problems.

Looking at the numbers:

- **WD Patients**: Although their platelet counts were lower before treatment with immunoglobulins (a type of medicine), the treatment effectively raised their platelet counts to near-normal levels, minimizing the risk of bleeding.
- **On the day before, during, and after surgery**: Their platelet counts remained similar to those of patients without WD, indicating a comparable risk of bleeding.
- **Less Bleeding Needed**: The need for blood product transfusions (specifically, platelets) after surgery was similar between WD patients and those without WD, suggesting that bleeding was not more frequent in the WD group.
- **Bleeding Complications**: While a slightly higher percentage of WD patients (10%) required reoperation for bleeding issues compared to those without WD (6%), this difference is not statistically significant, and the total blood lost was similar between the groups.

- **WD Patients**: Their platelet counts (important for blood clotting) were much lower than those without WD, even after getting treatment with immunoglobulins (a type of medicine). This means their blood wasn't clotting as well.
- **On the day before, during, and after surgery**: Their platelet counts were still significantly lower than people without WD, making them more prone to bleeding.
- **More Bleeding Needed**: These WD patients required more blood product transfusions (specifically, platelets) after surgery, which indicates more bleeding occurred or was anticipated.
- **Bleeding Complications**: Even though the total blood lost was similar between the groups, a higher number of WD patients (10%) had to go back into surgery for bleeding issues compared to those without WD (6%). This shows WD patients were actually at a higher risk for serious bleeding problems requiring intervention.

In short, the study shows that WD patients face a **real risk** for bleeding complications during and after this surgery. The lower platelet counts and higher need for treatment directly link WD with increased bleeding risks, which supports the ""yes"" answer.",yes,"It is generally assumed, that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Therefore we performed this case control study to estimate the real risk for bleeding complications of these patients.

The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Further research and investigation would be needed to establish a definitive causative link between the syndrome and tuberculosis in this case.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Is unsafe sexual behaviour increasing among HIV-infected individuals?,"There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.",no,"The study found no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sexual behavior among HIV-infected individuals over time. The odds ratio was 1.0 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.96-1.05, indicating that there was no significant change in reported unsafe sex practices.",no,"Context:
The number of new diagnoses of HIV infection is rising in the northwestern hemisphere and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the mechanisms behind this trend.
To evaluate whether reported unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV- infected individuals is changing over time.
Participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study were asked about their sexual practices every 6 months for 3 years during regular follow-up of the cohort beginning on 1 April 2000.
: Logistic regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations assuming a constant correlation between responses from the same individual.
At least one sexual behaviour questionnaire was obtained for 6545 HIV-infected individuals and the median number of questionnaires completed per individual was five. There was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time in this population [odds ratio (OR), 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.05]. Females (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.19-1.60), 15-30 year olds (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47), those with HIV-positive partners (OR, 12.58; 95% CI, 10.84-14.07) and those with occasional partners (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.87-3.67) were more likely to report unsafe sex. There was no evidence of a response bias over time, but individuals were less willing to leave questions about their sexual behaviour unanswered or ambiguous (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97).

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,The study suggests that there is a benefit of alcohol consumption with meals in reducing the risk of acute myocardial infarction. Consuming alcohol during meals may have a hypoinsulinemic effect which could be beneficial for heart health.,yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,The presence of a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome in the child may have contributed to the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis. Further investigation and research are needed to establish a causative link between the syndrome and tuberculosis in this case.,yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"The study indicates that consuming alcohol during meals is associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI), with an odds ratio of 0.50 for those drinking three or more drinks per day during meals. This suggests a potential protective effect when alcohol is consumed with food, possibly due to its hypoinsulinemic effects that may favorably influence cardiovascular risk factors. Conversely, alcohol consumed outside of meals does not show a significant protective trend. Therefore, if alcohol is to be consumed, doing so with meals might confer some benefit in reducing MI risk.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Therefore, NT thickness alone should not be used as a predictor for GDM.",no,"Context:
This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"The study indicates that alcohol consumption with meals is associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) compared to nondrinkers (OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82 for ≥3 drinks/day with meals). In contrast, drinking alcohol outside of meals does not show a similar protective effect (OR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.49-1.96). This suggests that the timing of alcohol intake—specifically, consuming alcohol with meals—may confer cardiovascular benefits, possibly due to metabolic effects such as reduced insulin response. However, it is important to note that these findings do not advocate for starting to drink alcohol for health reasons, and excessive alcohol consumption carries other health risks. The benefit appears specific to moderate consumption with meals, particularly in populations with regular wine intake.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of ""significant"" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.",yes,"The study demonstrates a discrepancy between patient and physician assessments of quality of life (QoL) in women with lower urinary tract symptoms. The concordance between patient and physician responses was poor (mean kappa: 0.33), indicating low agreement. Physicians both underestimated and overestimated QoL scores in different domains, and specifically underestimated the impact of symptoms on social limitations and emotions. This suggests that physicians' assessments do not always accurately reflect the patient's own experience, highlighting the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).
