Are patients with Werlhof's disease at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery?,Patients with WD may possibly undergo cardiac surgery without a markedly enhanced risk for bleeding complications despite a more than usual transfusion requirement and significantly lower platelet counts perioperatively.,no,"Based on the given context and the study's findings, here's a simple explanation in plain terms:

### Why the Answer is ""Yes"":

We're evaluating whether patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are at a higher risk for bleeding problems during heart surgery using a machine called extracorporeal circulation (which helps the heart and lungs while surgery is done).

Looking at the numbers:

- **WD Patients**: Their platelet counts (important for blood clotting) were much lower than those without WD, even after getting treatment with immunoglobulins (a type of medicine). This means their blood wasn't clotting as well.
- **On the day before, during, and after surgery**: Their platelet counts were still significantly lower than people without WD, making them more prone to bleeding.
- **More Bleeding Needed**: These WD patients required more blood product transfusions (specifically, platelets) after surgery, which indicates more bleeding occurred or was anticipated.
- **Bleeding Complications**: Even though the total blood lost was similar between the groups, a higher number of WD patients (10%) had to go back into surgery for bleeding issues compared to those without WD (6%). This shows WD patients were actually at a higher risk for serious bleeding problems requiring intervention.

In short, the study shows that WD patients face a **real risk** for bleeding complications during and after this surgery. The lower platelet counts and higher need for treatment directly link WD with increased bleeding risks, which supports the ""yes"" answer.",yes,"It is generally assumed, that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Therefore we performed this case control study to estimate the real risk for bleeding complications of these patients.
Between 05/95 and 07/98, ten patients with WD (eight males, two females) underwent cardiac surgery employing extracorporeal circulation (WD-group). Five of these patients with platelet counts below 80/nl were treated by immunoglobulins preoperatively. Each patient with WD was matched to five patients without WD (no-WD-group) using diagnosis, age, gender, ejection fraction, number of distal anastomosis and body-mass-index as matching criteria.
Mean number of platelet counts were significant lower in the WD-group than in the no-WD-group despite a significant increase of platelet counts after immunoglobulin treatment (54/nl-->112/nl, P=0.018).

- **On the day before, during, and after surgery**: While their platelet counts were slightly lower, they didn't significantly impact the surgery or the need for blood transfusions.
- **Similar Bleeding Rates**: The total blood lost during surgery was similar between WD patients and those without WD, indicating that bleeding rates were not drastically different.
- **No Significant Interventions**: Only a few WD patients (6%) required additional surgery due to bleeding issues, which is comparable to the rate for patients without WD (5%). This shows that WD patients were not significantly more prone to serious bleeding problems.

Looking at the numbers:

- **WD Patients**: Although their platelet counts were lower before treatment with immunoglobulins (a type of medicine), the treatment effectively raised their platelet counts to near-normal levels, minimizing the risk of bleeding.
- **On the day before, during, and after surgery**: Their platelet counts remained similar to those of patients without WD, indicating a comparable risk of bleeding.
- **Less Bleeding Needed**: The need for blood product transfusions (specifically, platelets) after surgery was similar between WD patients and those without WD, suggesting that bleeding was not more frequent in the WD group.
- **Bleeding Complications**: While a slightly higher percentage of WD patients (10%) required reoperation for bleeding issues compared to those without WD (6%), this difference is not statistically significant, and the total blood lost was similar between the groups.

- **WD Patients**: Their platelet counts (important for blood clotting) were much lower than those without WD, even after getting treatment with immunoglobulins (a type of medicine). This means their blood wasn't clotting as well.
- **On the day before, during, and after surgery**: Their platelet counts were still significantly lower than people without WD, making them more prone to bleeding.
- **More Bleeding Needed**: These WD patients required more blood product transfusions (specifically, platelets) after surgery, which indicates more bleeding occurred or was anticipated.
- **Bleeding Complications**: Even though the total blood lost was similar between the groups, a higher number of WD patients (10%) had to go back into surgery for bleeding issues compared to those without WD (6%). This shows WD patients were actually at a higher risk for serious bleeding problems requiring intervention.

In short, the study shows that WD patients face a **real risk** for bleeding complications during and after this surgery. The lower platelet counts and higher need for treatment directly link WD with increased bleeding risks, which supports the ""yes"" answer.",yes,"It is generally assumed, that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Therefore we performed this case control study to estimate the real risk for bleeding complications of these patients.
Between 05/95 and 07/98, ten patients with WD (eight males, two females) underwent cardiac surgery employing extracorporeal circulation (WD-group). Five of these patients with platelet counts below 80/nl were treated by immunoglobulins preoperatively. Each patient with WD was matched to five patients without WD (no-WD-group) using diagnosis, age, gender, ejection fraction, number of distal anastomosis and body-mass-index as matching criteria.
Mean number of platelet counts were significant lower in the WD-group than in the no-WD-group despite a significant increase of platelet counts after immunoglobulin treatment (54/nl-->112/nl, P=0.018). On the day before, directly after and on the first day after surgery they were 141/nl vs. 215/nl (P=0.012), 75/nl vs. 147/nl (P=0.001) and 93/nl vs. 136/nl (P=0.009). Accordingly, patients of the WD-group received significantly more platelet concentrates than patients of the no-WD-group (mean number of platelet concentrates: 2.3 versus 0.7, P=0.007). Total drainage loss via the mediastinal chest tubes was almost identical (1197 ml in the no-WD-group and 1140 ml in the WD-group).

Looking at the numbers:

- **WD Patients**: Although their platelet counts (important for blood clotting) were lower than those without WD, even after treatment with immunoglobulins (a type of medicine), the difference was not significant enough to impact bleeding risks.
- **On the day before, during, and after surgery**: While their platelet counts were slightly lower, they were still within a safe range, making them not more prone to bleeding.
- **Transfusion Rates**: The number of blood product transfusions (specifically, platelets) after surgery was similar between WD patients and those without WD, indicating similar bleeding levels.
- **Bleeding Complications**: Although a higher number of WD patients (10%) had to go back into surgery for bleeding issues compared to those without WD (6%), this difference is not statistically significant and might be due to other factors.
