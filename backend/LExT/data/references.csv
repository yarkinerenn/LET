Are patients with Werlhof's disease at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery?,Patients with WD may possibly undergo cardiac surgery without a markedly enhanced risk for bleeding complications despite a more than usual transfusion requirement and significantly lower platelet counts perioperatively.,no,"Based on the given context and the study's findings, here's a simple explanation in plain terms:

### Why the Answer is ""Yes"":

We're evaluating whether patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are at a higher risk for bleeding problems during heart surgery using a machine called extracorporeal circulation (which helps the heart and lungs while surgery is done).

Looking at the numbers:

- **WD Patients**: Their platelet counts (important for blood clotting) were much lower than those without WD, even after getting treatment with immunoglobulins (a type of medicine). This means their blood wasn't clotting as well.
- **On the day before, during, and after surgery**: Their platelet counts were still significantly lower than people without WD, making them more prone to bleeding.
- **More Bleeding Needed**: These WD patients required more blood product transfusions (specifically, platelets) after surgery, which indicates more bleeding occurred or was anticipated.
- **Bleeding Complications**: Even though the total blood lost was similar between the groups, a higher number of WD patients (10%) had to go back into surgery for bleeding issues compared to those without WD (6%). This shows WD patients were actually at a higher risk for serious bleeding problems requiring intervention.

In short, the study shows that WD patients face a **real risk** for bleeding complications during and after this surgery. The lower platelet counts and higher need for treatment directly link WD with increased bleeding risks, which supports the ""yes"" answer.",yes,"It is generally assumed, that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Therefore we performed this case control study to estimate the real risk for bleeding complications of these patients.
Between 05/95 and 07/98, ten patients with WD (eight males, two females) underwent cardiac surgery employing extracorporeal circulation (WD-group). Five of these patients with platelet counts below 80/nl were treated by immunoglobulins preoperatively. Each patient with WD was matched to five patients without WD (no-WD-group) using diagnosis, age, gender, ejection fraction, number of distal anastomosis and body-mass-index as matching criteria.
Mean number of platelet counts were significant lower in the WD-group than in the no-WD-group despite a significant increase of platelet counts after immunoglobulin treatment (54/nl-->112/nl, P=0.018).

- **On the day before, during, and after surgery**: While their platelet counts were slightly lower, they didn't significantly impact the surgery or the need for blood transfusions.
- **Similar Bleeding Rates**: The total blood lost during surgery was similar between WD patients and those without WD, indicating that bleeding rates were not drastically different.
- **No Significant Interventions**: Only a few WD patients (6%) required additional surgery due to bleeding issues, which is comparable to the rate for patients without WD (5%). This shows that WD patients were not significantly more prone to serious bleeding problems.

Looking at the numbers:

- **WD Patients**: Although their platelet counts were lower before treatment with immunoglobulins (a type of medicine), the treatment effectively raised their platelet counts to near-normal levels, minimizing the risk of bleeding.
- **On the day before, during, and after surgery**: Their platelet counts remained similar to those of patients without WD, indicating a comparable risk of bleeding.
- **Less Bleeding Needed**: The need for blood product transfusions (specifically, platelets) after surgery was similar between WD patients and those without WD, suggesting that bleeding was not more frequent in the WD group.
- **Bleeding Complications**: While a slightly higher percentage of WD patients (10%) required reoperation for bleeding issues compared to those without WD (6%), this difference is not statistically significant, and the total blood lost was similar between the groups.

- **WD Patients**: Their platelet counts (important for blood clotting) were much lower than those without WD, even after getting treatment with immunoglobulins (a type of medicine). This means their blood wasn't clotting as well.
- **On the day before, during, and after surgery**: Their platelet counts were still significantly lower than people without WD, making them more prone to bleeding.
- **More Bleeding Needed**: These WD patients required more blood product transfusions (specifically, platelets) after surgery, which indicates more bleeding occurred or was anticipated.
- **Bleeding Complications**: Even though the total blood lost was similar between the groups, a higher number of WD patients (10%) had to go back into surgery for bleeding issues compared to those without WD (6%). This shows WD patients were actually at a higher risk for serious bleeding problems requiring intervention.

In short, the study shows that WD patients face a **real risk** for bleeding complications during and after this surgery. The lower platelet counts and higher need for treatment directly link WD with increased bleeding risks, which supports the ""yes"" answer.",yes,"It is generally assumed, that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Therefore we performed this case control study to estimate the real risk for bleeding complications of these patients.

The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Further research and investigation would be needed to establish a definitive causative link between the syndrome and tuberculosis in this case.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Is unsafe sexual behaviour increasing among HIV-infected individuals?,"There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.",no,"The study found no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sexual behavior among HIV-infected individuals over time. The odds ratio was 1.0 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.96-1.05, indicating that there was no significant change in reported unsafe sex practices.",no,"Context:
The number of new diagnoses of HIV infection is rising in the northwestern hemisphere and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the mechanisms behind this trend.
To evaluate whether reported unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV- infected individuals is changing over time.
Participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study were asked about their sexual practices every 6 months for 3 years during regular follow-up of the cohort beginning on 1 April 2000.
: Logistic regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations assuming a constant correlation between responses from the same individual.
At least one sexual behaviour questionnaire was obtained for 6545 HIV-infected individuals and the median number of questionnaires completed per individual was five. There was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time in this population [odds ratio (OR), 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.05]. Females (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.19-1.60), 15-30 year olds (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47), those with HIV-positive partners (OR, 12.58; 95% CI, 10.84-14.07) and those with occasional partners (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.87-3.67) were more likely to report unsafe sex. There was no evidence of a response bias over time, but individuals were less willing to leave questions about their sexual behaviour unanswered or ambiguous (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97).

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,The study suggests that there is a benefit of alcohol consumption with meals in reducing the risk of acute myocardial infarction. Consuming alcohol during meals may have a hypoinsulinemic effect which could be beneficial for heart health.,yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,The presence of a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome in the child may have contributed to the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis. Further investigation and research are needed to establish a causative link between the syndrome and tuberculosis in this case.,yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"The study indicates that consuming alcohol during meals is associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI), with an odds ratio of 0.50 for those drinking three or more drinks per day during meals. This suggests a potential protective effect when alcohol is consumed with food, possibly due to its hypoinsulinemic effects that may favorably influence cardiovascular risk factors. Conversely, alcohol consumed outside of meals does not show a significant protective trend. Therefore, if alcohol is to be consumed, doing so with meals might confer some benefit in reducing MI risk.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Therefore, NT thickness alone should not be used as a predictor for GDM.",no,"Context:
This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"The study indicates that alcohol consumption with meals is associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) compared to nondrinkers (OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82 for ≥3 drinks/day with meals). In contrast, drinking alcohol outside of meals does not show a similar protective effect (OR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.49-1.96). This suggests that the timing of alcohol intake—specifically, consuming alcohol with meals—may confer cardiovascular benefits, possibly due to metabolic effects such as reduced insulin response. However, it is important to note that these findings do not advocate for starting to drink alcohol for health reasons, and excessive alcohol consumption carries other health risks. The benefit appears specific to moderate consumption with meals, particularly in populations with regular wine intake.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL.

Physicians both underestimated and overestimated QoL scores in different domains, and specifically underestimated the impact of symptoms on social limitations and emotions. This suggests that physicians' assessments do not always accurately reflect the patient's own experience, highlighting the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV.

A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"The study indicates that alcohol consumption with meals is associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) compared to nondrinkers (OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82 for ≥3 drinks/day with meals). In contrast, drinking alcohol outside of meals does not show a similar protective effect (OR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.49-1.96). This suggests that the timing of alcohol intake—specifically, consuming alcohol with meals—may confer cardiovascular benefits, possibly due to metabolic effects such as reduced insulin response. However, it is important to note that these findings do not advocate for starting to drink alcohol for health reasons, and excessive alcohol consumption carries other health risks. The benefit appears specific to moderate consumption with meals, particularly in populations with regular wine intake, as seen in this Italian cohort.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,"The presence of a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome, characterized by facial dysmorphy, microcephaly, and intellectual disability, suggests a congenital or genetic condition that may involve immune system abnormalities or structural vulnerabilities. Although the immunological work-up was normal, certain syndromes with craniofacial dysmorphy can be associated with subtle immune deficiencies or anatomical predispositions that increase susceptibility to infections like tuberculosis. The occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in this immunocompetent child with a syndromic presentation raises the possibility of a causative link, either through inherent immune dysregulation or structural factors related to the syndrome. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider a potential association between Say-Barber-Miller syndrome and susceptibility to tuberculosis, warranting further investigation and close clinical monitoring.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL.

Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,"The presence of a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome, characterized by facial dysmorphy, microcephaly, and intellectual disability, suggests a congenital or genetic basis that may impair immune function or structural integrity, potentially increasing susceptibility to infections like tuberculosis. Although the immunological work-up was normal, certain syndromes can predispose individuals to infections through subtle immune deficits or anatomical vulnerabilities. The occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in this immunocompetent child with a syndromic presentation raises the possibility of a causative link, warranting further investigation into the syndrome's role in susceptibility to tuberculosis.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of ""significant"" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.",yes,"The study findings indicate a relatively poor concordance (mean weighted kappa of 0.33) between patient and physician assessments of QoL related to LUTS, with physicians tending to underestimate the impact on social and emotional domains. This discrepancy suggests that physicians may not fully capture the patient's perceived burden, highlighting the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes into clinical assessments to ensure comprehensive understanding and management of LUTS.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?,"The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.",yes,"The study indicates that using an oversized acetabular component with a cup-cage construct in osteoporotic patients undergoing immediate THA can provide initial stability, as evidenced by the median proximal migration of less than 1 mm and sagittal rotation within acceptable limits at 1 year postoperatively. Although some components showed migration above the thresholds associated with loosening, the overall data suggest that this reconstruction technique offers a promising approach to achieving initial stability in osteoporotic acetabular fractures. The increased contact surface area and the use of an oversized cup contribute to better initial fixation, which is crucial in osteoporotic bone where fixation strength is compromised.",yes,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,"The presence of cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome suggests a potential link, possibly related to underlying genetic or developmental factors associated with the syndrome that may predispose to atypical or extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Although no direct causative relationship has been definitively established, the case raises the hypothesis that certain syndromic features or associated immune dysregulation could contribute to susceptibility. Further research is needed, but given the clinical findings and the rarity of such presentations, considering a possible link is reasonable.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL.

This suggests that physicians' assessments do not always accurately reflect patients' perceived quality of life, highlighting the importance of directly incorporating patient-reported outcomes in clinical evaluation.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.",yes,"The study indicates that cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups does not consistently provide initial stability in total hip arthroplasty (THA) for osteoporotic acetabular fractures. At 1 year postoperatively, 3 out of 10 components (30%) showed migration above the accepted limits that predict later loosening in primary THA. This suggests that a significant proportion of patients did not achieve adequate initial stability. Additionally, the contact surface between the acetabular component and the unfractured pelvis was relatively limited (15%-27% of the component), which may contribute to insufficient stability in osteoporotic bone. Therefore, while some patients may achieve acceptable stability, the technique does not reliably ensure initial stability for all, and the risk of early migration and potential loosening remains high.",no,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).

Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?,"While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.",maybe,"The study found that while 94% of parents could correctly recall their child's weight status after BMI screening, overall recall of the information provided was low—only 39% of the information was remembered.

Therefore, although most parents remembered the label (e.g., ""overweight""), they did not fully understand the details or significance of the information provided. This suggests that current methods of communicating BMI results may not be sufficient for ensuring parental understanding, which is crucial for motivating behavior change.",no,"Context:
As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

To study the prevalence of pain and risk factors for pain in psychiatric patients in a psychiatric hospital.
Using a questionnaire we investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential risk factors were explored.
The point prevalence of pain was about 50%, the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric diagnosis. Statistically significant risk factors for pain were depression (OR=6.05) and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals (OR=3.609).

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"The study indicates that alcohol consumption with meals is associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) compared to nondrinkers (OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82 for ≥3 drinks/day with meals). In contrast, drinking alcohol outside of meals does not show a similar protective effect (OR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.49-1.96). This suggests that the timing of alcohol intake—specifically, consuming alcohol with meals—may confer cardiovascular benefits, possibly due to metabolic effects such as reduced insulin response. However, it is important to note that these findings do not advocate for starting to drink alcohol for health reasons, and excessive alcohol consumption carries other health risks. Moderation and individual risk factors should always be considered.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Can surgeon familiarization with current evidence lead to a change in practice?,This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.,no,"The intervention of mailing a summary of current evidence did not lead to a statistically significant change in the practice of prophylactic nasogastric decompression among surgeons at the institution.

Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

To assess the extent to which the title and font of participant information sheets (PISs) can influence pregnant women's and trainee midwives' perceptions of an antenatal intervention.
Pregnant women (n=35) and trainee midwives (n=36) were randomly presented with one of four PISs where the title and font of the PIS had been manipulated to create four experimental conditions (i.e., Double Fluent; Double Awkward; Fluent Title-Awkward Font; Awkward Title-Fluent Font). After reading the PIS, participants rated their perceptions of the intervention (i.e., Attractiveness, Complexity, Expected Risk, Required Effort) using five-point Likert scales.

Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?,"The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients.

The median proximal migration at 1 year was 0.83 mm, which is below the threshold associated with loosening, and sagittal rotation was also within acceptable limits. Although some components showed migration above the suggested limits, the overall data suggest that this technique provides a promising initial stability, especially considering the challenging osteoporotic bone quality. Therefore, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups appears to offer adequate initial stability in this patient population.",yes,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).

Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?,"While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.",maybe,"The study indicates that a substantial proportion of parents (94%) could correctly recall their child's weight status after screening, demonstrating good recognition of the key information. However, fewer than 10 parents could accurately interpret what the measurements meant, suggesting that while recall of the label is high, understanding of the measurement implications is limited. The findings also show that the method of feedback (best practice care vs. motivational interviewing) influences recall, with BPC leading to slightly better recall scores. Additionally, factors such as maternal education and perceived usefulness of information significantly predict recall, implying that tailored communication strategies could enhance understanding. Therefore, parents do recall and understand at least some aspects of their child's weight status after screening, but there is room for improvement in conveying measurement meaning and ensuring comprehensive understanding.",yes,"Context:
As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

Is pain a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry?,We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.,yes,"The study indicates that approximately 50% of psychiatric patients experience pain at any given point, with even higher prevalence over 6 and 12 months. Common complaints such as low back pain, headache, and neck pain are frequent and can significantly impair functioning and work capacity. The strong association between pain and psychiatric conditions like depression underscores that pain is a prevalent and clinically relevant issue in adult psychiatry. Recognizing and managing pain in this population is essential for comprehensive psychiatric care.",yes,"Context:
To study the prevalence of pain and risk factors for pain in psychiatric patients in a psychiatric hospital.
Using a questionnaire we investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential risk factors were explored.
The point prevalence of pain was about 50%, the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric diagnosis. Statistically significant risk factors for pain were depression (OR=6.05) and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals (OR=3.609).

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,"The case describes a child with features suggestive of Say-Barber-Miller syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by facial dysmorphy, microcephaly, and intellectual disability. The occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent child with this syndrome raises the possibility of a causative or predisposing link. Although immunological work-up was normal, genetic syndromes can sometimes involve subtle immune deficiencies or structural anomalies that increase susceptibility to infections like tuberculosis. Given the rarity of such presentations and the potential for syndromic predisposition, it is reasonable to consider a possible association or increased risk, warranting further investigation and awareness.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"The study suggests that consuming alcohol with meals is associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction, with an odds ratio of 0.50 for those drinking three or more drinks per day during meals.

Therefore, moderate alcohol intake with meals might be considered beneficial in reducing MI risk, although individual health considerations and moderation are essential.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of ""significant"" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.",yes,"The study findings indicate a relatively poor concordance (mean weighted kappa of 0.33) between patient and physician assessments of QoL related to LUTS, with physicians tending to underestimate the impact on social and emotional domains. This discrepancy suggests that physicians may not fully capture the patient's perceived burden, highlighting the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes into clinical assessments to ensure comprehensive understanding and management of LUTS.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?,"The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.",yes,"The study indicates that using an oversized acetabular component with a cup-cage construct can achieve initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures. The median proximal migration at 1 year was 0.83 mm, which is below the threshold associated with loosening, and sagittal rotation was also within acceptable limits. Although some components showed migration above the recommended limits, the overall data suggest that this technique provides a promising initial fixation, especially considering the challenges posed by osteoporotic bone. Therefore, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups appears to offer adequate initial stability in this patient population.",yes,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).

Is pain a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry?,We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.,yes,"Pain is a highly prevalent and clinically relevant issue in general adult psychiatry, with a point prevalence of about 50% and over 75% experiencing pain within a 6- to 12-month period. The common complaints—low back pain, headache, shoulder, and neck pain—affect a significant portion of psychiatric patients and are associated with impairment and unfitness for work. The strong association between pain and psychiatric conditions such as depression (OR=6.05) underscores its importance in this population. Recognizing and managing pain in psychiatric patients is essential for comprehensive care and improving overall functioning.",yes,"Context:
To study the prevalence of pain and risk factors for pain in psychiatric patients in a psychiatric hospital.
Using a questionnaire we investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential risk factors were explored.
The point prevalence of pain was about 50%, the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric diagnosis. Statistically significant risk factors for pain were depression (OR=6.05) and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals (OR=3.609).

Can surgeon familiarization with current evidence lead to a change in practice?,This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.,no,"The intervention of mailing a summary of current evidence did not lead to a statistically significant change in the practice of prophylactic nasogastric decompression among surgeons at the institution.

Therefore, familiarization with current evidence alone does not appear to reliably change practice in this context.",no,"Context:
Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of ""significant"" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.",yes,"The study findings indicate a relatively poor concordance (mean weighted kappa of 0.33) between patient and physician assessments of QoL related to LUTS, with physicians tending to underestimate the impact on social and emotional domains. This discrepancy suggests that physicians may not fully capture the patient's perceived burden, highlighting the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes into clinical assessments to ensure comprehensive understanding and management of LUTS.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?,"The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients.

The median proximal migration at 1 year was 0.83 mm, which is below the threshold associated with loosening, and sagittal rotation was also within acceptable limits. Although some components showed migration above the recommended limits, the overall data suggest that this technique provides a promising initial fixation, especially considering the challenges posed by osteoporotic bone. Therefore, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups appears to offer adequate initial stability in this patient population.",yes,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,"The case describes a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome presenting with cerebromediastinal tuberculosis, which is a rare extrapulmonary manifestation. Although a direct causative link between the syndrome and tuberculosis has not been previously established, the immunodeficiency or developmental anomalies associated with syndromes like Say-Barber-Miller could potentially predispose to infections such as tuberculosis. The presence of recurrent infections and the complex neurodevelopmental features suggest an underlying immune or structural vulnerability. Therefore, while not definitively proven, it is plausible that the syndrome may contribute to susceptibility to such infections, supporting a possible causative or predisposing link.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Is unsafe sexual behaviour increasing among HIV-infected individuals?,"There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.",no,"The study's findings indicate that there was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sexual behavior among HIV-infected individuals over the study period (odds ratio 1.0; 95% CI, 0.96-1.05).

The number of new diagnoses of HIV infection is rising in the northwestern hemisphere and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the mechanisms behind this trend.
To evaluate whether reported unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV- infected individuals is changing over time.
Participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study were asked about their sexual practices every 6 months for 3 years during regular follow-up of the cohort beginning on 1 April 2000.
: Logistic regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations assuming a constant correlation between responses from the same individual.
At least one sexual behaviour questionnaire was obtained for 6545 HIV-infected individuals and the median number of questionnaires completed per individual was five. There was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time in this population [odds ratio (OR), 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.05]. Females (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.19-1.60), 15-30 year olds (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47), those with HIV-positive partners (OR, 12.58; 95% CI, 10.84-14.07) and those with occasional partners (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.87-3.67) were more likely to report unsafe sex. There was no evidence of a response bias over time, but individuals were less willing to leave questions about their sexual behaviour unanswered or ambiguous (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97).

This suggests that simply providing evidence summaries may not be sufficient to alter established practice patterns, and more comprehensive strategies might be necessary to effect change.",no,"Context:
Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL.

The relatively poor concordance (mean weighted kappa of 0.33) suggests that physicians tend to underestimate the impact of symptoms, particularly in social and emotional domains. This underestimation highlights the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes into clinical evaluations to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the patient's experience and to guide appropriate management.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?,"The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.",yes,"The study indicates that using an oversized acetabular component with a cup-cage construct in osteoporotic patients undergoing immediate THA can provide initial stability, as evidenced by the median proximal migration of less than 1 mm and sagittal rotation within acceptable limits at 1 year postoperatively. Although some components showed migration above the thresholds associated with loosening, the overall results suggest that this technique can achieve sufficient initial stability to support early mobilization. The increased contact surface area between the implant and pelvis may also contribute to improved stability in osteoporotic bone, which is often less capable of supporting standard-sized components. Therefore, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups appears to be a viable strategy to enhance initial stability in this challenging patient population.",yes,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).

Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?,"While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.",maybe,"The study indicates that a substantial proportion of parents (94%) could correctly recall their child's weight status after screening, demonstrating good recognition of the key information. However, fewer than 10 parents could accurately interpret what the measurements meant, suggesting that while recall of the label is high, understanding of the implications is limited. The findings also show that the method of feedback (best practice care) improved recall slightly, and factors such as maternal education and perceived usefulness of information influenced recall. Therefore, parents generally remember their child's weight status, but their understanding of the measurement details may be insufficient, highlighting the importance of effective communication strategies to enhance comprehension.",yes,"Context:
As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,"While the case describes a child with probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome presenting with cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis, current evidence does not establish a direct causative link between this syndrome and tuberculosis susceptibility.

However, the presence of congenital anomalies and developmental issues may potentially influence immune function indirectly. Given the rarity of such cases and lack of prior reports, it is plausible but not definitively proven that Say-Barber-Miller syndrome predisposes to tuberculosis. Further research and case accumulation are needed to clarify any causal relationship.",maybe,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

The number of new diagnoses of HIV infection is rising in the northwestern hemisphere and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the mechanisms behind this trend.
To evaluate whether reported unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV- infected individuals is changing over time.
Participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study were asked about their sexual practices every 6 months for 3 years during regular follow-up of the cohort beginning on 1 April 2000.
: Logistic regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations assuming a constant correlation between responses from the same individual.
At least one sexual behaviour questionnaire was obtained for 6545 HIV-infected individuals and the median number of questionnaires completed per individual was five. There was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time in this population [odds ratio (OR), 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.05].

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"The study suggests that consuming alcohol with meals is associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction, with an odds ratio of 0.50 for those drinking three or more drinks per day during meals.

Therefore, moderate alcohol intake with meals might be considered beneficial in reducing MI risk, although individual health considerations and guidelines should always be taken into account.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Therefore, surgeon familiarization with current evidence alone does not appear to reliably change practice in this context.",no,"Context:
Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of ""significant"" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.",yes,"The study findings indicate a relatively poor concordance (mean weighted kappa of 0.33) between patient and physician assessments of QoL related to LUTS, with physicians tending to underestimate the impact on social and emotional domains. This discrepancy suggests that physicians may not fully capture the patient's perceived burden, highlighting the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes into clinical assessments to ensure comprehensive understanding and management of LUTS.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?,"The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients.

The median proximal migration at 1 year was 0.83 mm, which is below the threshold associated with loosening, and sagittal rotation was also within acceptable limits. Although some components showed migration above the suggested limits, the overall data suggest that this technique provides a favorable initial fixation, especially considering the challenges posed by osteoporotic bone. Therefore, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups appears to offer adequate initial stability in this patient population.",yes,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively.

Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?,"While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.",maybe,"The study indicates that a substantial proportion of parents (94%) could correctly recall their child's weight status after screening, demonstrating good recall of this specific information. However, fewer parents could accurately interpret what the measurements meant, suggesting that while recall of the label is high, understanding of the implications is limited. Additionally, the type of feedback method influenced recall, with best practice care (BPC) leading to slightly better recall than motivational interviewing (MI). Factors such as maternal education and perceived usefulness of the information also predicted better recall. Therefore, parents generally remember their child's weight status after screening, but their understanding of measurement details may be limited, highlighting the importance of effective communication strategies to improve comprehension.",yes,"Context:
As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

Is unsafe sexual behaviour increasing among HIV-infected individuals?,"There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.",no,"The study's findings indicate that there was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sexual behavior among HIV-infected individuals over the study period (odds ratio of 1.0 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.96-1.05). This suggests that unsafe sexual practices have remained stable rather than increasing. Therefore, based on this data, unsafe sexual behavior is not currently rising among HIV-infected individuals in this cohort.",no,"Context:
The number of new diagnoses of HIV infection is rising in the northwestern hemisphere and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the mechanisms behind this trend.
To evaluate whether reported unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV- infected individuals is changing over time.
Participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study were asked about their sexual practices every 6 months for 3 years during regular follow-up of the cohort beginning on 1 April 2000.
: Logistic regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations assuming a constant correlation between responses from the same individual.
At least one sexual behaviour questionnaire was obtained for 6545 HIV-infected individuals and the median number of questionnaires completed per individual was five. There was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time in this population [odds ratio (OR), 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.05]. Females (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.19-1.60), 15-30 year olds (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47), those with HIV-positive partners (OR, 12.58; 95% CI, 10.84-14.07) and those with occasional partners (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.87-3.67) were more likely to report unsafe sex. There was no evidence of a response bias over time, but individuals were less willing to leave questions about their sexual behaviour unanswered or ambiguous (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97).

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"The study suggests that consuming alcohol with meals is associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction, with an odds ratio of 0.50 for those drinking three or more drinks per day during meals. This indicates a potential protective effect when alcohol is consumed in conjunction with meals, possibly due to its hypoinsulinemic effects that may favorably influence cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, moderate alcohol intake with meals might be considered beneficial in reducing MI risk, although individual health considerations and guidelines should always be taken into account.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome.

The occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent child with this syndrome raises the possibility of a causative link, potentially due to underlying genetic or developmental factors affecting immune function or tissue susceptibility. Although no direct immunodeficiency was identified in this case, the syndrome's features and the unusual localization of tuberculosis suggest that there may be an association worth further investigation. Therefore, considering the context and the rarity of such presentations, a probable link can be hypothesized.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of ""significant"" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.",yes,"The study findings indicate a relatively poor concordance (mean weighted kappa of 0.33) between patient and physician assessments of QoL, with physicians tending to underestimate the impact of LUTS on social and emotional domains. This discrepancy suggests that physicians may not fully capture the patient's subjective experience, highlighting the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes in clinical assessments to ensure comprehensive care.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?,"No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.",no,"The study demonstrates that women with major depression during pregnancy can be identified in population health data through multiple data sources, such as pharmaceutical dispensing records and hospital admission records. However, each source alone captures only a subset of cases, with significant under-ascertainment when relying on a single dataset. The linkage of these datasets improves case identification, suggesting that, with comprehensive data linkage and appropriate algorithms, women with major depression in pregnancy are identifiable in population health data. Nonetheless, limitations exist, such as under-recording of depression in hospital records and the potential for women to be identified solely through pharmacy data, emphasizing the importance of using multiple data sources for accurate ascertainment.",yes,"Context:
Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.
Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.
From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.

Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?,"In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.",no,"The study indicates that chemotherapy (cytostatic treatment) is associated with improved survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma, especially in those with better performance status (ECOG 0-1). The hazard ratio for survival favors chemotherapy, and its role as an independent prognostic factor suggests that its benefits observed in clinical trials are likely transferable to routine clinical practice. While skepticism among pneumologists may stem from concerns about real-world applicability, the evidence supports that chemotherapy can indeed improve survival outcomes in this patient population.",yes,"Context:
Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor.
Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis.
We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with symptomatic treatment.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of ""significant"" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.",yes,"The study findings indicate a relatively poor concordance (mean weighted kappa of 0.33) between patient and physician assessments of QoL related to LUTS, with physicians tending to underestimate the impact on social and emotional domains. This discrepancy suggests that physicians may not fully capture the patient's perceived burden, highlighting the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes into clinical assessments to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the patient's experience.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,"The case describes a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome presenting with cerebromediastinal tuberculosis, which is a rare and previously unreported manifestation in immunocompetent children. Given the genetic syndrome's features—such as facial dysmorphy, microcephaly, and intellectual disability—and the occurrence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, there may be an underlying link. Although the child's immunological work-up was normal, genetic syndromes can sometimes predispose to atypical infections or influence immune responses. Therefore, it is plausible that Say-Barber-Miller syndrome could be associated with increased susceptibility to certain forms of tuberculosis, including cerebromediastinal involvement.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?,"While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.",maybe,"The study indicates that a substantial proportion of parents (94%) could correctly recall their child's weight status after screening, demonstrating good recognition of the key information. However, fewer than 10 parents could accurately interpret what the measurements meant, suggesting that while recall of the label is high, understanding of the measurement implications is limited. The findings also show that the method of feedback (best practice care vs. motivational interviewing) influences recall, with BPC leading to slightly better recall scores. Additionally, factors such as maternal education and perceived usefulness of information significantly predict recall, implying that tailored communication strategies could enhance understanding. Therefore, parents do recall and understand at least some aspects of their child's weight status after screening, but there is room for improvement in conveying measurement meaning.",yes,"Context:
As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

Is unsafe sexual behaviour increasing among HIV-infected individuals?,"There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.",no,"The study's findings indicate that there was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sexual behavior among HIV-infected individuals over the study period (odds ratio of 1.0 with a 95% CI of 0.96-1.05). This suggests that unsafe sexual practices have remained stable rather than increasing. Therefore, based on this data, unsafe sexual behavior is not currently increasing among HIV-infected individuals.",no,"Context:
The number of new diagnoses of HIV infection is rising in the northwestern hemisphere and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the mechanisms behind this trend.
To evaluate whether reported unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV- infected individuals is changing over time.
Participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study were asked about their sexual practices every 6 months for 3 years during regular follow-up of the cohort beginning on 1 April 2000.
: Logistic regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations assuming a constant correlation between responses from the same individual.
At least one sexual behaviour questionnaire was obtained for 6545 HIV-infected individuals and the median number of questionnaires completed per individual was five. There was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time in this population [odds ratio (OR), 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.05]. Females (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.19-1.60), 15-30 year olds (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47), those with HIV-positive partners (OR, 12.58; 95% CI, 10.84-14.07) and those with occasional partners (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.87-3.67) were more likely to report unsafe sex. There was no evidence of a response bias over time, but individuals were less willing to leave questions about their sexual behaviour unanswered or ambiguous (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97).

Therefore, moderate alcohol intake with meals might be considered beneficial in reducing MI risk, although individual health considerations and moderation are important.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

To study the prevalence of pain and risk factors for pain in psychiatric patients in a psychiatric hospital.
Using a questionnaire we investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential risk factors were explored.
The point prevalence of pain was about 50%, the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric diagnosis.

Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?,"The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients.

Although some components showed migration above the thresholds associated with loosening, the overall results suggest that this technique can achieve sufficient initial stability to potentially reduce early loosening and improve outcomes in this high-risk population.",yes,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).

Does evidence-based practice improve patient outcomes?,The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.,yes,"The evidence from this natural experiment indicates that implementing an evidence-based practice (EBP) unit was associated with statistically significant improvements in patient outcomes, including reduced mortality rates and shorter lengths of stay, without increasing readmission rates. These findings suggest that EBP can lead to better patient outcomes by promoting more effective and efficient care. Although the study design is observational, the consistent improvements following the reorganization support the conclusion that EBP contributes positively to patient outcomes.",yes,"Context:
Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity.
We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test.
No statistically significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P = 0.002). No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P < 0.001) and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P < 0.001) than SP patients. Readmission rates were similar: 14.4% (EBP); 14.5% (SP). EBP doctors attended twice as many patients/doctor as SP doctors.

This suggests that simply providing evidence summaries may not be sufficient to alter established practice patterns, and more comprehensive or targeted strategies might be necessary to effect change.",no,"Context:
Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?,"No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.",no,"Women with major depression in pregnancy are not reliably identifiable in population health data. The study shows significant discrepancies between hospital admission records and pharmaceutical dispensing data. Only a small proportion (13.6%) of cases were identified by both data sources, and 80% of women who were dispensed antidepressants did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity in their hospital records. This indicates that relying on a single dataset underestimates the true prevalence, and even combining datasets leaves gaps. Therefore, population health data alone are insufficient for accurately identifying all women with major depression during pregnancy.",no,"Context:
Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.
Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.
From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.

Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?,"In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss.

Specifically, patients who received chemotherapy had a significantly longer median survival compared to those who received only palliative care (31 weeks overall, with a notable difference in the ECOG 2 group: 15 weeks vs. 11 weeks). While the absolute survival benefit may be modest, especially in patients with poorer performance status, the data support that chemotherapy does confer a survival advantage in real-world clinical practice, not just in clinical trials. Therefore, skepticism about the effectiveness of chemotherapy in this setting is not fully supported by the evidence presented.",yes,"Context:
Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor.
Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis.
We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with symptomatic treatment.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL.

Specifically, physicians tended to underestimate the impact of symptoms on social limitations and emotions, and there were both underestimations and overestimations across different QoL domains. This suggests that physicians may not fully appreciate the extent to which these symptoms affect patients' lives, highlighting the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes in clinical assessments.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,"There is currently no established causative link between Say-Barber-Miller syndrome (SBMS) and tuberculosis. SBMS is a rare genetic disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism, microcephaly, intellectual disability, and sometimes recurrent infections, but it is not classically associated with immunodeficiency. In the described case, the child had recurrent infections, which could suggest some underlying immune dysfunction, but an extensive immunological work-up was reportedly normal. Tuberculosis, especially extrapulmonary forms like cerebromediastinal TB, is rare in immunocompetent children. However, the presence of recurrent infections in this child raises the possibility of a subtle or undetected immune defect associated with SBMS that could predispose to TB. 

Given the lack of direct evidence and the rarity of both conditions, a definitive causative link cannot be established based on a single case. The association may be coincidental, or there may be an as-yet-unrecognized predisposition in SBMS. Further studies and case reports would be needed to clarify any potential link. Therefore, the answer is ""maybe.""",maybe,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"The study indicates that alcohol consumption with meals is associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) compared to nondrinkers (OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82 for ≥3 drinks/day with meals). In contrast, drinking alcohol outside of meals does not show a similar protective effect (OR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.49-1.96). This suggests that the timing of alcohol intake—specifically, consuming alcohol with meals—may confer cardiovascular benefits, possibly due to metabolic effects such as reduced insulin response. However, it is important to note that these findings do not advocate for starting to drink alcohol for health reasons, and excessive alcohol consumption carries other health risks. Moderation and individual risk factors should always be considered.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Additionally, the contact surface between the acetabular component and the unfractured pelvis was relatively limited (15%-27%), which may contribute to the variability in outcomes. Therefore, while this technique may provide initial stability for some patients, it does not guarantee it for all, and the risk of early migration and potential loosening remains. Careful patient selection and surgical technique are critical, and further studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up are needed to confirm the reliability of this approach.",maybe,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).

Does evidence-based practice improve patient outcomes?,The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.,yes,"The evidence from the natural experiment described in the context shows that evidence-based practice (EBP) does improve patient outcomes.

These findings support the conclusion that EBP leads to better patient outcomes compared to standard practice.",yes,"Context:
Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity.
We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test.
No statistically significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P = 0.002). No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P < 0.001) and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P < 0.001) than SP patients. Readmission rates were similar: 14.4% (EBP); 14.5% (SP). EBP doctors attended twice as many patients/doctor as SP doctors.

Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?,"In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.",no,"The study indicates that chemotherapy (cytostatic treatment) is associated with improved survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma, especially in those with better performance status (ECOG 0-1). The hazard ratio for survival favors chemotherapy, and the median survival is longer in patients receiving cytostatic treatment. Although some skepticism among pneumologists may stem from concerns about generalizability and real-world effectiveness, the evidence from this study supports the benefit of chemotherapy in this patient population. Therefore, skepticism may not be fully justified, and chemotherapy should be considered a valid treatment option in appropriate patients.",yes,"Context:
Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor.
Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis.
We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with symptomatic treatment.

Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

The occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent child with this syndrome suggests a potential link. While Say-Barber-Miller syndrome is rare and its immunological profile appears normal, the presence of recurrent infections indicates possible subtle immune dysfunction or genetic susceptibility that could predispose to tuberculosis. Given the novelty of this association and the absence of prior reports, it is plausible that the syndrome may contribute to increased vulnerability to extrapulmonary TB, possibly through genetic or developmental pathways affecting immune responses. Therefore, a causative or contributory link is possible, warranting further investigation.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive.

Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset during pregnancy?,"NT thickness does not show a significative increase in those women who subsequently develop GDM. Therefore, NT assessment does not prove to be an useful ultrasound parameter for predicting GDM onset during pregnancy.",no,"The study findings indicate that there was no significant difference in nuchal translucency (NT) thickness between women who developed GDM and those who did not (p = 0.585). The mean NT values were very similar in both groups, suggesting that NT measurement in the first trimester does not have predictive value for the onset of gestational diabetes mellitus. Therefore, NT thickness alone should not be used as a predictor for GDM during pregnancy.",no,"Context:
This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

To assess the extent to which the title and font of participant information sheets (PISs) can influence pregnant women's and trainee midwives' perceptions of an antenatal intervention.
Pregnant women (n=35) and trainee midwives (n=36) were randomly presented with one of four PISs where the title and font of the PIS had been manipulated to create four experimental conditions (i.e., Double Fluent; Double Awkward; Fluent Title-Awkward Font; Awkward Title-Fluent Font). After reading the PIS, participants rated their perceptions of the intervention (i.e., Attractiveness, Complexity, Expected Risk, Required Effort) using five-point Likert scales.
A 4×2 factorial multivariate analysis of variance revealed that pregnant women rated the Double Awkward condition as significantly more complex than the Double Fluent (p=.024) and Awkward Title-Fluent Font (p=.021) conditions.

Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?,"While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.",maybe,"The study indicates that a substantial proportion of parents (94%) could correctly recall their child's weight status after screening, demonstrating good recognition of the key information. However, fewer than 10 parents could accurately interpret what the measurements meant, suggesting that while recall of the label is high, understanding of the implications is limited. The findings also show that the method of feedback (best practice care vs. motivational interviewing) influences recall, with BPC leading to slightly better recall scores. Additionally, factors such as maternal education and perceived usefulness of information significantly predict recall, highlighting areas for improving understanding. Therefore, parents do recall and understand at least some aspects of their child's weight status after screening, but there is room to enhance comprehension of measurement significance.",yes,"Context:
As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

The number of new diagnoses of HIV infection is rising in the northwestern hemisphere and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the mechanisms behind this trend.
To evaluate whether reported unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV- infected individuals is changing over time.
Participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study were asked about their sexual practices every 6 months for 3 years during regular follow-up of the cohort beginning on 1 April 2000.
: Logistic regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations assuming a constant correlation between responses from the same individual.
At least one sexual behaviour questionnaire was obtained for 6545 HIV-infected individuals and the median number of questionnaires completed per individual was five.

Therefore, moderate alcohol intake with meals might be considered beneficial in reducing MI risk, although individual health considerations and guidelines should always be taken into account.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Is pain a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry?,We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.,yes,"Pain is a highly prevalent and clinically relevant issue in general adult psychiatry, as evidenced by the study showing a point prevalence of about 50% and a 12-month prevalence exceeding 75%. The common complaints—low back pain, headache, shoulder, and neck pain—affect a significant portion of psychiatric patients and are associated with impairment and unfitness for work. Furthermore, the strong association between pain and psychiatric conditions such as depression (OR=6.05) underscores its importance in this setting. Addressing pain in psychiatric patients is essential for comprehensive care and improving overall functioning.",yes,"Context:
To study the prevalence of pain and risk factors for pain in psychiatric patients in a psychiatric hospital.
Using a questionnaire we investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential risk factors were explored.
The point prevalence of pain was about 50%, the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric diagnosis. Statistically significant risk factors for pain were depression (OR=6.05) and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals (OR=3.609).

Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?,"The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.",yes,"The study indicates that using an oversized acetabular component with a cup-cage construct can achieve initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures. The median proximal migration at 1 year was 0.83 mm, which is below the threshold associated with loosening, and sagittal rotation was also within acceptable limits. Although some components showed migration above the recommended limits, the overall data suggest that this technique provides a promising initial stability, especially considering the challenging osteoporotic bone quality. Therefore, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups appears to offer adequate initial stability in this patient population.",yes,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).

Does evidence-based practice improve patient outcomes?,The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.,yes,"The data from this natural experiment indicate that the implementation of an evidence-based practice (EBP) unit was associated with statistically significant improvements in patient outcomes, including reduced mortality rates and shorter lengths of stay, without increasing readmission rates. These findings suggest that EBP can lead to better patient outcomes by promoting practices grounded in the best available evidence, which enhances the quality and efficiency of care. Therefore, adopting EBP appears to improve patient outcomes based on the observed data.",yes,"Context:
Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity.
We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test.
No statistically significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P = 0.002). No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P < 0.001) and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P < 0.001) than SP patients. Readmission rates were similar: 14.4% (EBP); 14.5% (SP). EBP doctors attended twice as many patients/doctor as SP doctors.

Can surgeon familiarization with current evidence lead to a change in practice?,This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.,no,"The intervention of mailing a summary of current evidence did not lead to a statistically significant change in the practice of prophylactic nasogastric decompression among surgeons at the institution. Despite efforts to increase awareness, the proportion of patients receiving NG decompression remained similar before and after the intervention. This suggests that simply providing evidence summaries may not be sufficient to alter established practice patterns, and more comprehensive strategies might be necessary to effect change.",no,"Context:
Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?,"No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.",no,"The study indicates that women with major depression during pregnancy are not reliably identifiable solely through hospital admission records, as only a small proportion (13.6%) of cases were captured in both datasets. A significant number of women receiving antidepressants did not have depression recorded in hospital records, suggesting that relying on hospital data alone underestimates the true prevalence. Therefore, population health data based solely on hospital admissions are insufficient to accurately identify women with major depression in pregnancy. Combining multiple data sources, such as pharmacy dispensing records and hospital data, improves detection, but even then, some cases may be missed.",no,"Context:
Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.
Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.
From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.

Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?,"In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.",no,"The study indicates that chemotherapy (cytostatic treatment) is associated with improved survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma, especially in those with better performance status (ECOG 0-1). The hazard ratio for survival benefit suggests that patients receiving chemotherapy have a statistically significant longer median survival compared to those receiving only palliative care. Given these findings, the skepticism of pneumologists regarding the transferability of clinical trial benefits to routine practice appears justified, but the evidence supports that chemotherapy can indeed improve outcomes in selected patients. Therefore, the cautious use of chemotherapy in appropriate patients is justified, and skepticism should be balanced with evidence-based benefits.",yes,"Context:
Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor.
Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis.
We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with symptomatic treatment.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of ""significant"" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.",yes,"The study findings indicate a discrepancy between patient and physician assessments of quality of life (QoL) in women with lower urinary tract symptoms. The relatively poor concordance (mean weighted kappa of 0.33) suggests that physicians tend to underestimate the impact of symptoms, especially in domains related to social limitations and emotional well-being. This underestimation highlights the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes to accurately gauge QoL and guide appropriate management.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,"The case describes a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome, characterized by facial dysmorphy, microcephaly, and intellectual disability, along with recurrent infections. The occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis, confirmed by positive culture and imaging, suggests a possible link between the syndrome and increased susceptibility to tuberculosis. Although the immunological work-up was normal, certain syndromic conditions can predispose to infections due to structural or functional abnormalities not detected by standard tests. Given the rarity of such presentations and the potential for syndromic predisposition, it is plausible that Say-Barber-Miller syndrome may be associated with an increased risk of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, including cerebro-mediastinal forms. Therefore, a causative or contributory link is possible, warranting further investigation and awareness in similar cases.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

To assess the extent to which the title and font of participant information sheets (PISs) can influence pregnant women's and trainee midwives' perceptions of an antenatal intervention.
Pregnant women (n=35) and trainee midwives (n=36) were randomly presented with one of four PISs where the title and font of the PIS had been manipulated to create four experimental conditions (i.e., Double Fluent; Double Awkward; Fluent Title-Awkward Font; Awkward Title-Fluent Font). After reading the PIS, participants rated their perceptions of the intervention (i.e., Attractiveness, Complexity, Expected Risk, Required Effort) using five-point Likert scales.
A 4×2 factorial multivariate analysis of variance revealed that pregnant women rated the Double Awkward condition as significantly more complex than the Double Fluent (p=.024) and Awkward Title-Fluent Font (p=.021) conditions.

Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?,"While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.",maybe,"The study indicates that a substantial proportion of parents (94%) could correctly recall their child's weight status after screening, demonstrating good recognition of the key information. However, fewer than 10 parents could accurately interpret what the measurements meant, suggesting that while recall of the label is high, understanding of the measurement implications is limited. The findings also show that the method of feedback (best practice care vs. motivational interviewing) influences recall, with BPC leading to slightly better recall scores. Additionally, factors such as maternal education and perceived usefulness of information significantly predict recall, highlighting the importance of tailored communication. Therefore, parents do recall and understand at least some aspects of their child's weight status after screening, but comprehension of measurement details may be limited, emphasizing the need for clear, effective communication strategies.",yes,"Context:
As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

Therefore, moderate alcohol intake with meals might be considered beneficial in reducing MI risk, although individual health considerations and guidelines should always be taken into account.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

To determine whether post-operative administration of topical ropivacaine hydrochloride decreases morbidity following adenotonsillectomy.
Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
University referral center; ENT Department.
Fourty one children, aged 4-16 years, undergoing tonsillectomy.
Patients received 1.0% ropivacaine hydrochloride soaked swabs packed in their tonsillar fossae while the control group received saline-soaked swabs. Mc Grath's face scale was used to compare the two groups in respect of pain control. Chi-square and two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney-U-tests were used to compare the two independent groups. As 10 we made 11 comparison between groups, for Bonferroni correction, p<0.005 was accepted as statistically significant.
Only first hour there was no significant pain-relieving effect seen in the ropivacaine group (p>0.05). The other hours and days there were statistically significance between the two groups (p<0.001). Also, the other post-operative parameters such as nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia and trismus were not statistically different between the two groups. There were no complications associated with ropivacaine hydrochloride. No patients in this study suffered systemic side effects related to the use of this medication.

Recognizing and managing pain in this population is essential for comprehensive psychiatric care.",yes,"Context:
To study the prevalence of pain and risk factors for pain in psychiatric patients in a psychiatric hospital.
Using a questionnaire we investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential risk factors were explored.
The point prevalence of pain was about 50%, the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric diagnosis. Statistically significant risk factors for pain were depression (OR=6.05) and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals (OR=3.609).

Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?,"The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients.

The median proximal migration at 1 year was 0.83 mm, which is below the threshold associated with loosening, and sagittal rotation was also within acceptable limits. Although some components showed migration above the suggested limits, the overall data suggest that this technique provides sufficient initial stability to support early mobilization and potentially reduce early loosening risks in this high-risk population.",yes,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).

Does evidence-based practice improve patient outcomes?,The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.,yes,"The data from this natural experiment indicate that the implementation of an evidence-based practice (EBP) unit was associated with statistically significant improvements in patient outcomes, including reduced mortality rates and shorter lengths of stay, without increasing readmission rates. These findings suggest that EBP can lead to better patient outcomes by promoting more effective and efficient care. Although the study design is observational, the consistent improvements following the reorganization support the conclusion that evidence-based practice contributes positively to patient health and hospital efficiency.",yes,"Context:
Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity.
We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test.
No statistically significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P = 0.002). No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P < 0.001) and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P < 0.001) than SP patients. Readmission rates were similar: 14.4% (EBP); 14.5% (SP). EBP doctors attended twice as many patients/doctor as SP doctors.

Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression.

Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?,"No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.",no,"Women with major depression in pregnancy are not reliably identifiable in population health data. The study shows significant discrepancies between hospital admission records and pharmaceutical dispensing data. Only a small proportion (13.6%) of cases were identified by both data sources, and 80% of women who were dispensed antidepressants did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity in their hospital records. This indicates that relying on a single dataset underestimates the true prevalence, and even combining datasets leaves gaps. Therefore, population health data alone are insufficient for accurately identifying all women with major depression during pregnancy.",no,"Context:
Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.
Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.
From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.

Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?,"In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss.

Specifically, patients who received chemotherapy had a significantly longer median survival compared to those who received only palliative care (31 weeks overall, with a notable difference in the ECOG 2 group: 15 weeks vs. 11 weeks). While the absolute survival benefit may be modest, especially in patients with poorer performance status, the data support that chemotherapy does confer a survival advantage in real-world clinical practice, not just in clinical trials. Therefore, skepticism about the effectiveness of chemotherapy in this setting is not fully supported by the evidence presented.",yes,"Context:
Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor.
Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis.
We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with symptomatic treatment.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL.

This suggests that physicians' assessments do not always accurately reflect the patient's own perception of their quality of life, highlighting the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV.

We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria.

To assess the extent to which the title and font of participant information sheets (PISs) can influence pregnant women's and trainee midwives' perceptions of an antenatal intervention.
Pregnant women (n=35) and trainee midwives (n=36) were randomly presented with one of four PISs where the title and font of the PIS had been manipulated to create four experimental conditions (i.e., Double Fluent; Double Awkward; Fluent Title-Awkward Font; Awkward Title-Fluent Font). After reading the PIS, participants rated their perceptions of the intervention (i.e., Attractiveness, Complexity, Expected Risk, Required Effort) using five-point Likert scales.
A 4×2 factorial multivariate analysis of variance revealed that pregnant women rated the Double Awkward condition as significantly more complex than the Double Fluent (p=.024) and Awkward Title-Fluent Font (p=.021) conditions.

Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?,"While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.",maybe,"The study found that while 94% of parents could correctly recall their child's weight status after BMI screening, overall recall of the information provided was low—only 39% of the information was remembered. Furthermore, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant, indicating a lack of understanding of the implications of their child's weight status. This suggests that although parents may remember being told their child is overweight, they often do not fully understand the details or significance of the information provided during BMI screening. Factors such as maternal education and perceived usefulness of the information were associated with better recall, but overall, most parents did not recall or understand the information well.",no,"Context:
As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

The number of new diagnoses of HIV infection is rising in the northwestern hemisphere and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the mechanisms behind this trend.
To evaluate whether reported unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV- infected individuals is changing over time.
Participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study were asked about their sexual practices every 6 months for 3 years during regular follow-up of the cohort beginning on 1 April 2000.
: Logistic regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations assuming a constant correlation between responses from the same individual.
At least one sexual behaviour questionnaire was obtained for 6545 HIV-infected individuals and the median number of questionnaires completed per individual was five. There was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time in this population [odds ratio (OR), 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.05]. Females (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.19-1.60), 15-30 year olds (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47), those with HIV-positive partners (OR, 12.58; 95% CI, 10.84-14.07) and those with occasional partners (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.87-3.67) were more likely to report unsafe sex. There was no evidence of a response bias over time, but individuals were less willing to leave questions about their sexual behaviour unanswered or ambiguous (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97).

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"The study indicates that alcohol consumption with meals is associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) compared to nondrinkers (OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82 for ≥3 drinks/day with meals). In contrast, drinking alcohol outside of meals does not show a similar protective effect (OR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.49-1.96). This suggests that the timing of alcohol intake—specifically, consuming alcohol with meals—may confer cardiovascular benefits, possibly due to metabolic effects such as reduced insulin response. However, it is important to note that excessive alcohol consumption carries other health risks, and recommendations should be individualized. Moderation and context (with meals) appear to be key factors in any potential benefit.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Continuation of pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid administration: opportunity for rescue?,"Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.",maybe,"The data indicate that a significant proportion of women who receive antenatal corticosteroids (AC) for threatened preterm birth remain pregnant for more than a week after administration—specifically, 17.9% delivered at <34 weeks but more than 1 week after AC, and 35.7% delivered at ≥34 weeks. This suggests that the initial course of AC may not always coincide with the actual timing of preterm delivery, potentially reducing the maximal benefit of the steroids for fetal lung maturity. Therefore, there is an opportunity for ""rescue"" or repeat AC administration in women who remain at risk for preterm delivery after the initial course, especially if delivery does not occur within 7 days of the first dose. However, the decision to give a rescue course should be individualized, considering the risks and benefits, and current guidelines.

To study the prevalence of pain and risk factors for pain in psychiatric patients in a psychiatric hospital.
Using a questionnaire we investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential risk factors were explored.
The point prevalence of pain was about 50%, the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric diagnosis. Statistically significant risk factors for pain were depression (OR=6.05) and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals (OR=3.609).

Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?,"The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone.

At 1 year, the median proximal migration and sagittal rotation of the acetabular component were within acceptable limits for most patients, indicating initial stability. However, 3 out of 10 components showed migration above the thresholds that predict later loosening, suggesting that initial stability was not achieved in all cases. Additionally, the contact surface between the acetabular component and the unfractured pelvis was relatively limited (15%-27% of the component), which may contribute to the risk of instability in some patients. Therefore, while this technique may provide initial stability for some patients, it does not guarantee it for all, especially in the context of osteoporotic bone and complex fractures. Careful patient selection and surgical technique remain critical.",maybe,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).

These findings indicate that EBP leads to better patient outcomes without increasing readmissions, supporting the adoption of evidence-based approaches in clinical practice.",yes,"Context:
Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity.
We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test.
No statistically significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P = 0.002). No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P < 0.001) and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P < 0.001) than SP patients. Readmission rates were similar: 14.4% (EBP); 14.5% (SP). EBP doctors attended twice as many patients/doctor as SP doctors.

Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?,"No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.",no,,"the research question is clear, the objective of this study is well stated, and the hypothesis is clear and relevant. however, there are some issues that need to be addressed before the study can proceed.","Context:
Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.
Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.
From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.

Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?,"In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.",no,,"1) is there a correlation between ecog score, weight loss and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma?","Context:
Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor.
Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis.
We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with symptomatic treatment.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of ""significant"" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.",yes,,yes.,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Pregnant women (n=35) and trainee midwives (n=36) were randomly presented with one of four PISs where the title and font of the PIS had been manipulated to create four experimental conditions (i.e., Double Fluent; Double Awkward; Fluent Title-Awkward Font; Awkward Title-Fluent Font). After reading the PIS, participants rated their perceptions of the intervention (i.e., Attractiveness, Complexity, Expected Risk, Required Effort) using five-point Likert scales.
A 4×2 factorial multivariate analysis of variance revealed that pregnant women rated the Double Awkward condition as significantly more complex than the Double Fluent (p=.024) and Awkward Title-Fluent Font (p=.021) conditions.

Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?,"While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.",maybe,,"prediction: m, a, y, b, e","Context:
As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

Is unsafe sexual behaviour increasing among HIV-infected individuals?,"There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.",no,,no,"Context:
The number of new diagnoses of HIV infection is rising in the northwestern hemisphere and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the mechanisms behind this trend.
To evaluate whether reported unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV- infected individuals is changing over time.
Participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study were asked about their sexual practices every 6 months for 3 years during regular follow-up of the cohort beginning on 1 April 2000.
: Logistic regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations assuming a constant correlation between responses from the same individual.
At least one sexual behaviour questionnaire was obtained for 6545 HIV-infected individuals and the median number of questionnaires completed per individual was five. There was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time in this population [odds ratio (OR), 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.05]. Females (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.19-1.60), 15-30 year olds (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47), those with HIV-positive partners (OR, 12.58; 95% CI, 10.84-14.07) and those with occasional partners (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.87-3.67) were more likely to report unsafe sex. There was no evidence of a response bias over time, but individuals were less willing to leave questions about their sexual behaviour unanswered or ambiguous (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97).

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,,y,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

To determine whether post-operative administration of topical ropivacaine hydrochloride decreases morbidity following adenotonsillectomy.
Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
University referral center; ENT Department.
Fourty one children, aged 4-16 years, undergoing tonsillectomy.
Patients received 1.0% ropivacaine hydrochloride soaked swabs packed in their tonsillar fossae while the control group received saline-soaked swabs. Mc Grath's face scale was used to compare the two groups in respect of pain control. Chi-square and two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney-U-tests were used to compare the two independent groups. As 10 we made 11 comparison between groups, for Bonferroni correction, p<0.005 was accepted as statistically significant.
Only first hour there was no significant pain-relieving effect seen in the ropivacaine group (p>0.05). The other hours and days there were statistically significance between the two groups (p<0.001). Also, the other post-operative parameters such as nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia and trismus were not statistically different between the two groups. There were no complications associated with ropivacaine hydrochloride. No patients in this study suffered systemic side effects related to the use of this medication.

To study the prevalence of pain and risk factors for pain in psychiatric patients in a psychiatric hospital.
Using a questionnaire we investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential risk factors were explored.
The point prevalence of pain was about 50%, the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric diagnosis. Statistically significant risk factors for pain were depression (OR=6.05) and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals (OR=3.609).

We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.",yes,,questions/,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively.

Does evidence-based practice improve patient outcomes?,The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.,yes,,question 1: does evidence-based practice improve patient outcomes?,"Context:
Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity.
We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test.
No statistically significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P = 0.002). No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P < 0.001) and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P < 0.001) than SP patients. Readmission rates were similar: 14.4% (EBP); 14.5% (SP). EBP doctors attended twice as many patients/doctor as SP doctors.

Can surgeon familiarization with current evidence lead to a change in practice?,This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.,no,,yes,"Context:
Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?,"No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.",no,"The study indicates that women with major depression during pregnancy are not reliably identifiable solely through hospital admission records, as only a small proportion (13.6%) of cases were captured in both datasets. A significant number of women receiving antidepressants did not have depression recorded in hospital data, suggesting that relying on hospital records alone underestimates the true prevalence. Therefore, population health data, particularly hospital admission records, are insufficient to fully identify women with major depression in pregnancy. Combining multiple data sources, such as pharmacy dispensing records and hospital data, improves detection but still may not capture all cases, highlighting limitations in population health data for this purpose.",no,"Context:
Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.
Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.
From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.

Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?,"In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.",no,"The study indicates that cytostatic (chemotherapy) treatment is associated with improved survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma, especially in those with better performance status (ECOG 0-1). The hazard ratio for treatment was significant (HR 1.85; P=.002), suggesting that chemotherapy provides a survival benefit beyond palliative care alone. While some skepticism among pneumologists may stem from concerns about treatment efficacy in real-world settings, the evidence from this study supports the notion that chemotherapy can be an independent predictor of improved survival in selected patients. Therefore, the skepticism may not be fully justified, and chemotherapy should be considered a valuable treatment option in appropriate cases.",yes,"Context:
Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor.
Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis.
We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with symptomatic treatment.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL.

This discrepancy suggests that physicians may not fully capture the patient's perceived burden, highlighting the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes into clinical assessments to ensure comprehensive understanding and management of LUTS.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

The occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent child with this syndrome suggests a potential link. While Say-Barber-Miller syndrome is rare and its immunological profile appears normal, the presence of recurrent infections indicates possible subtle immune dysfunction or genetic susceptibility that could predispose to tuberculosis. Given the novelty of this presentation and the absence of prior reports, it is plausible that the syndrome may contribute to increased vulnerability to extrapulmonary TB, possibly through genetic or developmental pathways affecting immune responses. Therefore, a causative or contributory link is possible, warranting further investigation.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset during pregnancy?,"NT thickness does not show a significative increase in those women who subsequently develop GDM. Therefore, NT assessment does not prove to be an useful ultrasound parameter for predicting GDM onset during pregnancy.",no,"The study findings indicate that there is no significant difference in nuchal translucency (NT) thickness between women who developed GDM and those who did not (p = 0.585).

Therefore, NT measurement in the first trimester should not be relied upon to predict GDM development.",no,"Context:
This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

To assess the extent to which the title and font of participant information sheets (PISs) can influence pregnant women's and trainee midwives' perceptions of an antenatal intervention.
Pregnant women (n=35) and trainee midwives (n=36) were randomly presented with one of four PISs where the title and font of the PIS had been manipulated to create four experimental conditions (i.e., Double Fluent; Double Awkward; Fluent Title-Awkward Font; Awkward Title-Fluent Font). After reading the PIS, participants rated their perceptions of the intervention (i.e., Attractiveness, Complexity, Expected Risk, Required Effort) using five-point Likert scales.
A 4×2 factorial multivariate analysis of variance revealed that pregnant women rated the Double Awkward condition as significantly more complex than the Double Fluent (p=.024) and Awkward Title-Fluent Font (p=.021) conditions.

Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?,"While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.",maybe,"The study indicates that a substantial proportion of parents (94%) could correctly recall their child's weight status after screening, demonstrating good recognition of the key information. However, fewer parents could accurately interpret what the measurements meant, suggesting that while recall of the label is high, understanding of the measurement implications is limited. The findings also show that the method of feedback (best practice care vs. motivational interviewing) influences recall, with BPC leading to slightly better recall scores. Additionally, factors such as maternal education and perceived usefulness of information significantly predict recall, highlighting areas for targeted improvement. Overall, parents do recall and understand at least the basic weight status information, but there is room to enhance comprehension of measurement details.",yes,"Context:
As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

Therefore, moderate alcohol intake with meals might be beneficial in reducing MI risk, although individual health considerations and overall lifestyle should be taken into account.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Three hundred twenty-one (46.4%) delivered within 1 week of AC; 92 of those women (13.3%) delivered within 24 hours. Only 124 (17.9%) remained pregnant 1 week after AC and delivered at<34 weeks. The latter were compared to women delivering>2 week after AC but>or = 34 weeks. More likely to deliver at<34 weeks were those women who received AC for premature preterm rupture of membranes (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.06-7.17), twins (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.42-5.95) or before 28 weeks (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.38-3.52).

Is pain a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry?,We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.,yes,"The study indicates that approximately 50% of psychiatric patients experience pain at any given point, with even higher prevalence over 6 and 12 months (75.5% and 76.5%, respectively). The most common complaints—low back pain, headache, shoulder, and neck pain—are frequent and can significantly impair functioning. Additionally, pain is notably associated with certain psychiatric diagnoses, especially depression, and can lead to impairment and unfitness for work. These findings demonstrate that pain is a prevalent and clinically relevant problem in adult psychiatry, warranting attention in assessment and management strategies.",yes,"Context:
To study the prevalence of pain and risk factors for pain in psychiatric patients in a psychiatric hospital.
Using a questionnaire we investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential risk factors were explored.
The point prevalence of pain was about 50%, the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric diagnosis. Statistically significant risk factors for pain were depression (OR=6.05) and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals (OR=3.609).

Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?,"The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.",yes,"The study indicates that using an oversized acetabular component with a cup-cage construct can achieve initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures. The median proximal migration at 1 year was 0.83 mm, which is below the threshold associated with loosening, and sagittal rotation was also within acceptable limits. Although some components showed migration above the recommended limits, the overall data suggest that this technique provides a promising initial fixation, especially considering the challenges posed by osteoporotic bone. Therefore, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups appears to offer adequate initial stability in this patient population.",yes,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).

Does evidence-based practice improve patient outcomes?,The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.,yes,"The data from this natural experiment indicate that the implementation of an evidence-based practice (EBP) unit was associated with statistically significant improvements in patient outcomes, including reduced mortality rates and shorter lengths of stay, without increasing readmission rates. These findings suggest that EBP can lead to better patient outcomes by promoting more effective and efficient care. Although the study design is observational, the consistent improvements post-implementation support the conclusion that evidence-based practice has a positive impact on patient outcomes.",yes,"Context:
Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity.
We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test.
No statistically significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P = 0.002). No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P < 0.001) and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P < 0.001) than SP patients. Readmission rates were similar: 14.4% (EBP); 14.5% (SP). EBP doctors attended twice as many patients/doctor as SP doctors.

Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV.

We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,,"y, e, s","Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?,"No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.",no,"Women with major depression in pregnancy can be identifiable in population health data through record linkage of routinely collected health datasets, such as hospital admission datasets and dispensing claims datasets. This study demonstrated that by linking administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from various datasets, women with depression during pregnancy could be ascertained. The study found that around 16% of pregnant women in the population had depression, highlighting the potential for identification of this condition in population health data.",yes,"Context:
Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.
Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.
From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.

Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?,"In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.",no,"The study found that cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor of survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma. This suggests that pneumologists' skepticism towards chemotherapy may not be justified, as it was shown to have a significant impact on survival in this study.",yes,"Context:
Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor.
Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis.
We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with symptomatic treatment.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of ""significant"" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.",yes,"The study findings suggest that there is a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment, with physicians tending to underestimate the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms on social limitations and emotions. This highlights the importance of considering patient-reported outcomes in addition to physician assessments in the management of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,"The presence of a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome in the child may have contributed to the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis. This syndrome is associated with facial dysmorphy, microcephaly, and mental retardation, which could potentially affect the immune system and increase susceptibility to infections such as tuberculosis. Further research and investigation would be needed to establish a definitive causative link between the syndrome and tuberculosis in this case.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?,"While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.",maybe,"The study found that although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. This indicates that while parents may remember the basic information about their child's weight status, they may not fully understand the implications or significance of the measurements.",no,"Context:
As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

Is unsafe sexual behaviour increasing among HIV-infected individuals?,"There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.",no,The study found no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sexual behavior among HIV-infected individuals over time. This suggests that unsafe sexual behavior may not be increasing in this population.,no,"Context:
The number of new diagnoses of HIV infection is rising in the northwestern hemisphere and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the mechanisms behind this trend.
To evaluate whether reported unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV- infected individuals is changing over time.
Participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study were asked about their sexual practices every 6 months for 3 years during regular follow-up of the cohort beginning on 1 April 2000.
: Logistic regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations assuming a constant correlation between responses from the same individual.
At least one sexual behaviour questionnaire was obtained for 6545 HIV-infected individuals and the median number of questionnaires completed per individual was five. There was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time in this population [odds ratio (OR), 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.05]. Females (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.19-1.60), 15-30 year olds (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47), those with HIV-positive partners (OR, 12.58; 95% CI, 10.84-14.07) and those with occasional partners (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.87-3.67) were more likely to report unsafe sex. There was no evidence of a response bias over time, but individuals were less willing to leave questions about their sexual behaviour unanswered or ambiguous (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97).

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,The study suggests that there may be a benefit of alcohol consumption with meals in reducing the risk of acute myocardial infarction. Consuming alcohol during meals may have a hypoinsulinemic effect which could potentially be protective against MI.,yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

To determine whether post-operative administration of topical ropivacaine hydrochloride decreases morbidity following adenotonsillectomy.
Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
University referral center; ENT Department.
Fourty one children, aged 4-16 years, undergoing tonsillectomy.
Patients received 1.0% ropivacaine hydrochloride soaked swabs packed in their tonsillar fossae while the control group received saline-soaked swabs. Mc Grath's face scale was used to compare the two groups in respect of pain control. Chi-square and two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney-U-tests were used to compare the two independent groups. As 10 we made 11 comparison between groups, for Bonferroni correction, p<0.005 was accepted as statistically significant.
Only first hour there was no significant pain-relieving effect seen in the ropivacaine group (p>0.05). The other hours and days there were statistically significance between the two groups (p<0.001). Also, the other post-operative parameters such as nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia and trismus were not statistically different between the two groups. There were no complications associated with ropivacaine hydrochloride. No patients in this study suffered systemic side effects related to the use of this medication.

Using a questionnaire we investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential risk factors were explored.
The point prevalence of pain was about 50%, the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric diagnosis. Statistically significant risk factors for pain were depression (OR=6.05) and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals (OR=3.609).

We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.",yes,"The study found that three out of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively, indicating that cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups did not provide sufficient initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures.",no,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).

Does evidence-based practice improve patient outcomes?,The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.,yes,"The study showed that the establishment of an Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) unit in a hospital led to improved patient outcomes, including lower mortality rates and shorter length of stay, compared to standard practice. This suggests that evidence-based practice can indeed improve patient outcomes.",yes,"Context:
Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity.
We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test.
No statistically significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P = 0.002). No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P < 0.001) and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P < 0.001) than SP patients. Readmission rates were similar: 14.4% (EBP); 14.5% (SP). EBP doctors attended twice as many patients/doctor as SP doctors.

Can surgeon familiarization with current evidence lead to a change in practice?,This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.,no,The study did not find a statistically significant difference in prophylactic NG use between the pre-intervention and post-intervention groups. This suggests that simply mailing out a summary of current evidence may not be enough to change surgeons' practice in this particular case. Additional interventions or strategies may be needed to effectively change practice.,no,"Context:
Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,"Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis can occur in children, although it is rare. There are documented case reports and evidence in the medical literature describing children presenting with both central nervous system (cerebral) and mediastinal involvement due to tuberculosis.

Early recognition and treatment are crucial for better outcomes.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"I can assume the role of a Medical advisor and provide information or guidance based on medical knowledge. However, please note that my advice should not replace consultation with a licensed healthcare professional for personal medical concerns.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?,"No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.",no,"While it is possible to identify some women with major depression during pregnancy using population health (administrative) data, there are significant limitations. Women who use antidepressants or are hospitalized for depression may be missed if their pregnancy is not recorded in the data. Additionally, the estimated prevalence of depression in this population (16%) is lower than previously reported (25%), suggesting that not all cases are captured. Therefore, identification is possible but incomplete.",maybe,"Context:
Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.
Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.
From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.

Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?,"In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.",no,"The aim of the study is clearly stated, focusing on analyzing prognostic factors related to survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma patients treated with chemotherapy or palliative therapy. The methods used are appropriate for the research question, and the results are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, indicating robust findings. Therefore, I recommend this article for indexing.",yes,"Context:
Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor.
Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis.
We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with symptomatic treatment.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of ""significant"" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.",yes,The prediction requires reasoning because the answer is not directly stated and must be inferred or deduced from the information provided.,yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,"The article requires reasoning to predict a potential association between cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis and Say-Barber-Miller syndrome, as the causal link is not formally established but discussed as a possibility by the authors.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset during pregnancy?,"NT thickness does not show a significative increase in those women who subsequently develop GDM. Therefore, NT assessment does not prove to be an useful ultrasound parameter for predicting GDM onset during pregnancy.",no,"The information provided is insufficient to definitively determine whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) values are associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) onset during pregnancy.

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?,"While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.",maybe,"Research indicates that while some parents recall and understand their child's weight status information after BMI screening, many do not. Factors such as the clarity of communication, parental health literacy, and emotional responses can affect recall and understanding. Therefore, parental recall and comprehension are inconsistent and cannot be universally affirmed.",maybe,"Context:
As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"The main reason is that it was not clear if alcohol consumption in this study was assessed by self-report or by blood alcohol concentration (BAC). If the former, then there could be a reporting bias in the responses. However, if the latter, then the results may indicate that drinking with meals reduces BAC levels.",maybe,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/
This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.
Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively.

Can surgeon familiarization with current evidence lead to a change in practice?,This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.,no,"The prediction ""0"" indicates that reasoning is not required, so the answer is ""no.""",no,"Context:
Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?,"No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.",no,"Women with major depression in pregnancy are **not reliably identifiable** in population health data using routinely collected administrative datasets. The study shows significant discrepancies between hospital admission records and pharmaceutical dispensing claims: only 13.6% of cases were identified by both data sources, and 80% of women dispensed antidepressants did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity in hospital records. This indicates that relying on a single dataset (either hospital or dispensing data) will miss a substantial proportion of cases. Even when both datasets are linked, under-ascertainment remains likely, as some women may not be captured by either method (e.g., those untreated or undiagnosed). Therefore, while some women with major depression in pregnancy can be identified, the population health data are insufficient for comprehensive or accurate identification.",no,"Context:
Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.
Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.
From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.

Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?,"In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss.

This benefit was especially notable in patients with better performance status (ECOG 0-1), where both weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Even in patients with ECOG 2, chemotherapy provided a modest survival advantage (median survival 15 weeks vs. 11 weeks with symptomatic treatment). Therefore, while real-world outcomes may not always match those seen in clinical trials, the evidence supports the use of chemotherapy in appropriately selected patients with advanced NSCLC, and broad skepticism is not warranted.",no,"Context:
Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor.
Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis.
We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with symptomatic treatment.

This suggests that physicians' assessments do not reliably reflect patients' own perceptions of their QoL, highlighting the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome.

The occurrence of cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent child with probable SBMS is unusual and has not been previously described in the literature. While it is possible that an underlying, as-yet-uncharacterized immune defect related to SBMS could predispose to tuberculosis, there is insufficient evidence to confirm a direct causative link. Therefore, the answer is ""maybe""—a link is possible but not proven.",maybe,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Therefore, NT measurement should not be used as a screening tool for GDM risk.",no,"Context:
This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

To assess the extent to which the title and font of participant information sheets (PISs) can influence pregnant women's and trainee midwives' perceptions of an antenatal intervention.
Pregnant women (n=35) and trainee midwives (n=36) were randomly presented with one of four PISs where the title and font of the PIS had been manipulated to create four experimental conditions (i.e., Double Fluent; Double Awkward; Fluent Title-Awkward Font; Awkward Title-Fluent Font). After reading the PIS, participants rated their perceptions of the intervention (i.e., Attractiveness, Complexity, Expected Risk, Required Effort) using five-point Likert scales.
A 4×2 factorial multivariate analysis of variance revealed that pregnant women rated the Double Awkward condition as significantly more complex than the Double Fluent (p=.024) and Awkward Title-Fluent Font (p=.021) conditions.

Do parents recall and understand children's weight status information after BMI screening?,"While parents remember that their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to remember much of the information and advice provided about the result.",maybe,"The study found that while 94% of parents could correctly recall their child's weight status after BMI screening, overall recall of the information provided was low—only 39% of the information was remembered. Furthermore, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant, indicating a lack of understanding of the implications of the BMI results. Therefore, although most parents remembered the label (e.g., ""overweight""), they did not fully understand the details or significance of the information provided. This suggests that parents generally do not recall and understand children's weight status information well after BMI screening.",no,"Context:
As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

The number of new diagnoses of HIV infection is rising in the northwestern hemisphere and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the mechanisms behind this trend.
To evaluate whether reported unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV- infected individuals is changing over time.
Participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study were asked about their sexual practices every 6 months for 3 years during regular follow-up of the cohort beginning on 1 April 2000.
: Logistic regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations assuming a constant correlation between responses from the same individual.
At least one sexual behaviour questionnaire was obtained for 6545 HIV-infected individuals and the median number of questionnaires completed per individual was five.

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"The study indicates that alcohol consumption with meals is associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) compared to nondrinkers (OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82 for ≥3 drinks/day). In contrast, drinking alcohol outside of meals does not show a similar protective effect (OR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.49-1.96). This suggests that the timing of alcohol intake—specifically, consuming alcohol with meals—may confer cardiovascular benefits, possibly due to metabolic effects such as reduced insulin response. However, it is important to note that these findings do not advocate for starting to drink alcohol for health reasons, and excessive alcohol consumption carries other health risks. The benefit appears specific to moderate consumption with meals, particularly in populations with regular wine intake.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively.

Does evidence-based practice improve patient outcomes?,The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.,yes,"The evidence from the described natural experiment indicates that evidence-based practice (EBP) does improve patient outcomes. After the establishment of the EBP unit, there was a statistically significant reduction in patient mortality (from 7.4% to 6.3%, P < 0.02) and length of hospital stay (from 9.15 to 6.01 days, P = 0.002) compared to both their own previous performance and to the standard practice (SP) group, which did not show similar improvements. Additionally, EBP patients had a lower risk of death (6.27% vs 7.75%, P < 0.001) and shorter length of stay (6.01 vs 8.46 days, P < 0.001) than SP patients, with similar readmission rates. These findings support the conclusion that EBP leads to better patient outcomes.",yes,"Context:
Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity.
We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test.
No statistically significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P = 0.002). No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P < 0.001) and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P < 0.001) than SP patients. Readmission rates were similar: 14.4% (EBP); 14.5% (SP). EBP doctors attended twice as many patients/doctor as SP doctors.

Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?,"No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.",no,"Women with major depression in pregnancy are not reliably or comprehensively identifiable in population health data. The study shows significant discrepancies between hospital admission records and pharmaceutical dispensing data. Only 13.6% of cases were identified by both data sources, and 80% of women dispensed antidepressants did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity in hospital records. This indicates that relying on a single dataset (either hospital or dispensing claims) will miss a substantial proportion of cases. Even with data linkage, ascertainment is incomplete, and the true prevalence is likely underestimated. Therefore, current population health data do not allow for accurate identification of all women with major depression during pregnancy.",no,"Context:
Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.
Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.
From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.

Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is pneumologists' skepticism justified?,"In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss.

Patients who received chemotherapy had a longer median survival compared to those who received only palliative care, even after adjusting for other prognostic factors such as ECOG performance status and weight loss. While the absolute survival benefit is modest (e.g., 15 weeks vs. 11 weeks in ECOG 2 patients), it is statistically significant and clinically relevant for some patients. Therefore, while skepticism may arise from concerns about toxicity, quality of life, or applicability of clinical trial data to real-world patients, the evidence supports a survival benefit from chemotherapy in this population.",no,"Context:
Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor.
Patients enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis.
We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with symptomatic treatment.

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL.

This suggests that physicians' assessments do not always accurately reflect the patient's perceived quality of life, highlighting the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,"There is currently no established causative link between Say-Barber-Miller syndrome (SBMS) and tuberculosis. SBMS is a rare genetic disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism, microcephaly, intellectual disability, and sometimes recurrent infections, as seen in this case. The child described was immunocompetent on extensive immunological work-up, but her history of recurrent infections suggests a possible subtle or undetected immune dysfunction associated with SBMS. This could theoretically predispose her to infections like tuberculosis, but there is no direct evidence or previously reported cases linking SBMS specifically to an increased risk of tuberculosis, especially of the cerebromediastinal type. Therefore, while a causative link is possible, it remains speculative and unproven at this time. Further studies or case reports would be needed to clarify any association.",maybe,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

To assess the extent to which the title and font of participant information sheets (PISs) can influence pregnant women's and trainee midwives' perceptions of an antenatal intervention.
Pregnant women (n=35) and trainee midwives (n=36) were randomly presented with one of four PISs where the title and font of the PIS had been manipulated to create four experimental conditions (i.e., Double Fluent; Double Awkward; Fluent Title-Awkward Font; Awkward Title-Fluent Font).

Therefore, although most parents remembered the label (e.g., ""overweight""), they did not fully understand the details or significance of the information provided during the feedback session. This suggests that current methods of communicating BMI results may not be sufficient for ensuring parental understanding, and additional strategies may be needed to improve comprehension and support behavior change.",no,"Context:
As parents of young children are often unaware their child is overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and understand the information they received about their overweight child after weight screening.
Randomised controlled trial of different methods of feedback.
Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care but appointments took place at a University research clinic.
1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of information from the feedback session.
Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of interest.
Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of recall score in multivariate analyses.

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,"The study indicates that alcohol consumption with meals is associated with a reduced risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) compared to nondrinkers (OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82 for ≥3 drinks/day). In contrast, drinking alcohol outside of meals does not show a similar benefit (OR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.49-1.96). This suggests that the timing of alcohol intake—specifically, consuming alcohol with meals—may confer a protective effect against MI, possibly due to metabolic factors such as a hypoinsulinemic response. However, it is important to note that these findings do not advocate for starting to drink alcohol for health reasons, and excessive alcohol consumption carries other health risks. The benefit appears specific to moderate intake with meals, particularly in populations with regular wine consumption.",yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?,"The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone.

At 1 year, the median migration and rotation of the acetabular component were within acceptable limits for most patients, indicating initial stability. However, 3 out of 10 components showed migration above the thresholds that predict later loosening, suggesting that initial stability was not achieved in all cases. Additionally, the contact surface between the acetabular component and the unfractured pelvis was relatively limited (15%-27% of the component), which may contribute to the risk of instability in some patients. Therefore, while this technique may provide initial stability for some patients, there is a significant risk of early migration and potential loosening, especially in the context of osteoporotic bone. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up are needed to confirm the reliability of this approach.",maybe,"Context:
The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/

Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.
At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).

Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity.
We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test.
No statistically significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P = 0.002).

Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring it more in line with current evidence.
The use of prophylactic nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use.
Twenty two patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant.

Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?,"Context:
Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.
The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the answer is ""None"" for the given biomedical question. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is about programmed cell death (PCD) in the lace plant, specifically looking at mitochondrial dynamics. The context provided is a detailed study on how PCD progresses in the leaves of the lace plant. It explains that PCD starts in the center of areoles and moves outward, stopping near the vasculature. The study uses MitoTracker Red to stain mitochondria and categorizes their dynamics into four stages (M1-M4). They also used a TUNEL assay to show DNA fragmentation, which is a marker of apoptosis.

The study mentions treating the plant with cyclosporine A (CsA), which is known to inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). The result was fewer perforations in the leaves, suggesting that PTP formation is important for PCD in this plant.

Now, the question is asking why the answer is ""None."" Since the context provided doesn't include any specific question, I'm assuming the user is asking why the answer isn't listed among the provided options, which in this case, there are no options given—just ""None.""

So, perhaps the intended answer is that there's no specific answer provided in the context, or the correct answer isn't among any options listed, hence ""None."" Alternatively, it might be that the question is about the role of mitochondrial dynamics, and since the context doesn't explicitly state the answer, the default is ""None.""

I might be overcomplicating it. Maybe the user is asking why the answer isn't among the given choices, but since the context doesn't provide specific options, ""None"" is the appropriate response.

The study demonstrates that inhibiting the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) using cyclosporine A (CsA) reduces perforations in the leaves, implying that mitochondrial dynamics are crucial for PCD.

Okay, so I need to figure out if mitochondria play a role in remodeling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death. Let me start by understanding the context given.

The lace plant undergoes PCD, which creates perforations in its leaves. The leaves have a structure with longitudinal and transverse veins forming areoles, and PCD happens in the central cells, spreading outward but stopping near the vasculature. I know that in animals, mitochondria are involved in PCD, but it's less studied in plants.

The paper talks about studying mitochondrial dynamics in vivo in the lace plant. They divided an areole into three areas: cells not undergoing PCD (NPCD), early PCD (EPCD), and late PCD (LPCD). They used MitoTracker Red to stain mitochondria and categorized their dynamics into four types (M1-M4) based on distribution, motility, and membrane potential. 

They also used a TUNEL assay, which detects fragmented nuclear DNA, showing a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. They looked at chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands with live imaging. Additionally, they treated the plants with cyclosporine A (CsA), which affects the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). This treatment resulted in fewer perforations and mitochondrial dynamics similar to non-PCD cells.

So, putting this together: the study shows that mitochondrial dynamics change during PCD, and inhibiting PTP formation with CsA reduces perforations. This suggests that mitochondria are involved in the PCD process that leads to leaf remodeling. The TUNEL assay showing DNA fragmentation also ties into apoptosis, where mitochondria often play a role by releasing factors that lead to DNA fragmentation.

Therefore, the key points are that mitochondrial dynamics, membrane potential, and the effect of CsA treatment all point to mitochondria playing a role in PCD-related remodeling in the lace plant leaves.

Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,"Alcohol drinking during meals was inversely related with risk of acute MI, whereas alcohol drinking outside meals only was unrelated to risk.",yes,The study suggests that there may be a benefit of consuming alcohol with meals in relation to the risk of acute myocardial infarction. The hypoinsulinemic effect of alcohol when consumed with meals may play a role in this potential benefit.,yes,"Context:
The apparent favorable effect of alcohol on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be related to its hypoinsulinemic effect when consumed with meals. We studied how the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals might affect the risk of MI in a population with relatively high regular alcohol consumption.
We conducted a case-control study between 1995 and 1999 in Milan, Italy. Cases were 507 subjects with a first episode of nonfatal acute MI, and controls were 478 patients admitted to hospitals for other acute diseases. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression models.
Compared with nondrinkers, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only (for>or =3 drinks per day: OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30-0.82). In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals (for>or =3 drinks per day: 0.98; 0.49-1.96). The pattern of risk was similar when we considered people who drank only wine.

Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?,"[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.",yes,"The presence of a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome in the child may have contributed to the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis. This syndrome is associated with facial dysmorphy, microcephaly, and recurrent infections, which could potentially weaken the immune system and make the child more susceptible to infections such as tuberculosis. Further research and studies would be needed to establish a definitive causative link between the syndrome and tuberculosis in this case.",yes,"Context:
Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.

Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset during pregnancy?,"NT thickness does not show a significative increase in those women who subsequently develop GDM. Therefore, NT assessment does not prove to be an useful ultrasound parameter for predicting GDM onset during pregnancy.",no,"The study found no significant difference in nuchal translucency thickness between the group of pregnant women who developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and the control group. Therefore, based on the results of this study, nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester does not appear to predict the onset of GDM during pregnancy.",no,"Context:
This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.
From January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test.
There was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54).

Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,"This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of ""significant"" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.",yes,"The study findings suggest that there is a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment, with physicians tending to underestimate the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms on social limitations and emotions. This highlights the importance of considering patient-reported outcomes in addition to physician assessments in the management of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction.",yes,"Context:
Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).
Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.
Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).

Lying can cause what when trying to find accurate information?,"When someone lies, they tell wrong informations. This can create a confusion between what is right and what is wrong. Distrust and feelings can get hurt when you catch someone lying.  It is a bad act and does not lead to good things. Also, lying for information does not create unhappiness.",confusion,"Choice 1, distrust, is the most direct consequence of lying when trying to find accurate information. When a person lies in an attempt to obtain or convey certain facts, it typically erodes trust between individuals because people often rely on honesty as a foundation for believing and acting upon shared knowledge. This breakdown in confidence can have significant negative implications for relationships and effective communication.

Beyond just the immediate impact of distrusting someone who has lied to you, such actions also create an environment where trust becomes more challenging over time if lies are prevalent or unpunished within a context—further compounding relational issues between parties seeking truth and transparency.

While choices 2 (hurt feelings) and 5 (unhappiness) could be indirect consequences of dishonesty, they do not universally arise from the act itself as directly as distrust does; these emotions may depend on personal sensitivities or additional context surrounding a given situation. Choice 3 (confusion), while potentially plausible in some scenarios involving multiple falsehoods that contradict each other—muddying clear understanding furthermore than one lie alone would—is generally not the primary consequence of lying, as confusion is more typically associated with complex or poorly communicated information rather than deceitfulness per se. Lastly, choice 4 (good things) clearly does not correspond to a typical outcome from dishonest conduct aimed at finding accurate facts and thus can be disregarded immediately for this context.
